## About Me

I am currently a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Future Technology](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ft/main.htm), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).

My first advisor was **Prof. [Wei Li](http://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496659.html)**. Under his supervision, I developed my core research intuition and methodology. Any of my current and future work is fundamentally built on what I learned from him. He is my *academic parent*, and I remain deeply grateful to him.

I am currently advised by **Prof. [Fan Zhang](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Fan_Zhang81)** on scientific computing. Specifically, we aim to use deep learning as a relatively low-cost yet high-accuracy alternative to traditional DNS / LES / RANS for high-Reynolds-number fluid simulations. I am now making modest contributions toward this long-term vision.

## Research Interests

In the short term, my goal is to **strengthen my research methodology**. I have worked in different labs with different advisors on both mainstream topics such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), as well as less mainstream areas including causal inference and spatiotemporal forecasting.

In the long term, my primary research goal is to **advance efficient scientific computing through deep learning**.
